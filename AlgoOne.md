##Introduction to Algorithms

####Moore's Law -:
1. A prediction made in 1965 by Intel co­‐founder Gordon Moore that the *density of transistors in integrated circuits would continue to double every 1 to 2 years*.

####Karatsuba Multiplication -:
1. The Karatsuba algorithm was the first multiplication algorithm *asymptotically faster than the quadratic "grade school" algorithm*.
2. It reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to at most ==3n^1.585^== single-digit multiplications.
3. Three multiplications in Karatsuba's basic step involve operands with fewer than n digits. These products can be computed by recursive calls of the Karatsuba algorithm.
